          We are a small organization that wishes to help the community.
        </div><div>We are conscious of the waste of food that happens in Philadelphia.</div><div></div>
        <div> Therefore, we formed our group project for our program, Phil the Hunger.</div>
        <div> We decided to make a website that gives people the ability to help their community.</div>
        <div>The reason we picked Phil the Hunger as our name was to fill the shelters of Philly with food.</div>
        <div> We wanted to decrease the waste of food around Philly as well as help those in need.</div>
