    <h2> Mission Statement</h2>
    <h3><center id ='size'>Our mission is to be able to help provide food to people who have limited or no access to sources of nutrition.
    We want to decrease the amount of preventable food waste and use those resources to donate to those in need.
    Child starvation is a huge problem in Philadelphia and it can very much be prevented when restaurants and farms donate food that are still edible.</h3></center>
