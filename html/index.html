    <h2 class ="titles"><b> <center>Our Mission Statement...</center></b></h2>

    <h3 class = "text"><p><center> Is to be able to help provide food to people who have limited or no access to sources of nutrition.
    We want to decrease the amount of preventable food waste and use those resources to donate to those in need.
    Child starvation is a huge problem in Philadelphia and it can very much be prevented when restaurants and farms donate food that are still edible.</center></h3></p>

    <p class = "text">We are a group of girls that are from Philadelphia and are passionate about programming.
       We decided to use our skills to create a website that will help others in our community that are struggling.
       We saw that Philly has a huge increase in food insecruity so we wanted to do something about it.
       We thought about ways that we can intergrate technology to helping feed our community.
       We discovered that food waste is a huge problem as well, so we figured we could solve both problems by creating a website that intergrates food donation using leftovers. </p>
